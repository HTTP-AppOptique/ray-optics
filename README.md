# Ray Optics Simulation
Simulate reflection and refraction of light.

## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in plane or arc mirror
- Simulate refraction in plane or arc interfaces, including both refracted and reflected rays
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obeys lens/mirror equation
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance and angular measurement
