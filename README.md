# Ray-Optics

Derivate work from https://ricktu288.github.io/ray-optics/, funded by a grant from ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche), under the scope of [ANR-20-NCUN-0001] project.

Online version of the simulator is available [here](https://http-appoptique.github.io/ray-optics/)

## Original features

- various light sources: ray, beam, and point source
- reflection in plane or arc mirror
- refraction in plane or arc interfaces, including both refracted and reflected rays
- ideal lens/mirror, which obeys lens/mirror equation
- extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- real images, virtual images and virtual objects directly
- images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance and angular measurement

## Added features

- Objects rotation
- object grouping/moving
- guides (lines)
- labels
- mode highlighting (create/update/move)
- easier object creation (by angles, sizes, ...)
- easier object selection
- french i18n support
- Cauchy's law (dispersion)
- canvas export (png, transparent background)
- variable light intensity for extended or ghost rays
- cm units support
